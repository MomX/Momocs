Description: Momocs is intended to ease and to popularize morphometrics, the
    quantitative analysis of form. It aims, eventually, at gathering the most common
    approaches: traditional morphometrics, global descriptors, open outlines,
    closed outlines and configuration of landmarks into the same, open-source,
    environment. It hinges on the core functions developed in the book
    'Morphometrics with R' by Julien Claude (2008), extend them graphically and
    statistically, using the same, unified and extendable, grammar. From import
    from other morphometrics format or data acquisition, to display, handling,
    calibration and calculations on morphometrics datasets on which to apply an
    array of statistical analyses, Momocs intends to provides a complete,
    convenient and extendable toolkit to specialists within every field that
    are, or may be, interested in integrating shape in their researches.
