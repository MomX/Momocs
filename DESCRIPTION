Description: A complete toolkit for 2D morphometrics, from data
       extraction to multivariate analyses. Most common
       morphometrics approaches are included: outlines, curves,
       landmarks, "traditional" morphometrics, and facilities for
       data preparation, manipulation and visualization with a
       consistent grammar throughout. Momocs allows reproducible and
       complex morphometric analyses, other approaches to be plugged
       in or developped from those existing, and paves the way for a
       pure open-source workflow in R.
