Description: Momocs is intended to ease and to popularize morphometrics, the quantitative analysis of form. It aims at gathering the most common approaches: traditional morphometrics, global descriptors, open outlines, closed outlines and configuration of landmarks into the same, open-source, environment. It hinges on the core functions developed in the book \emph{Morphometrics with R} by Claude (2008), wraps them into the same coding grammar, and extends them both graphically and statistically. From data acquisition to display, handling, calibration and calculations on morphometrics datasets, and then multivariate analyses, Momocs intends to provides a complete, convenient and extendable toolkit to specialists within every field that are, or may be, interested in integrating shape in their researches.
