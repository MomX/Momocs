Description: Momocs is an R package which aims to provide a complete and
    convenient toolkit for morphometrics. It is intended for scientists
    interested in describing quantitatively the shape, and its variations, of
    the objects they study. In the last decade, R has become the open-source
    lingua franca for statistics, and morphometrics known its so-called
    'revolution'. Nevertheless, morphometric analyses still have to be carried
    out using various software packages, for which source code is mostly
    unavailable or copyrighted. Moreover, existing software packages cannot be
    extended and their bugs are hard to detect and thus correct. This situation
    is detrimental to morphometrics; time is wasted, analyses are restricted to
    available methods, and last but not least, are poorly reproducible. This
    impedes collaborative effort both in software development and in
    morphometric studies. By gathering the common morphometric approaches in an
    open-source environment and welcoming contributions, Momocs is an
    (work-in-progress) attempt to solve this twofold problem and to push
    morphometrics one step further. It hinges on the core functions published
    in the book Morphometrics using R (Claude, 2008), but has been further
    extended to allow other shape description systems. So far, configurations
    of landmarks, outlines and open outline analyses, along with some
    facilities for traditional morphometrics have been implemented. Prior to
    analysis, Momocs can be used to acquire and manipulate data or to
    import/export from/to other formats. Momocs also has the facility for a
    wide range of multivariate analyses and production of the companion
    graphics. Thus a researcher will find that just a few lines of code will
    provide initial results, but the methods implemented can be finely tuned
    and extended according to the user's needs.
