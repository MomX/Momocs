Description: A complete toolkit for morphometrics, from data extraction to multivariate
          analyses. Most common 2D morphometrics approaches are included: outlines, open
          outlines, configurations of landmarks, traditional morphometrics, and facilities
          for data preparation, manipulation and visualization with a consistent grammar
          throughout. Momocs allows reproducible, complex morphometric analyses, paves the
          way for a pure open-source workflow in R, and other morphometrics approaches
          should be easy to plug in, or develop from, on top of this canvas.
