# Momocs 1.4.1
* Removed rgeos dependency so that Momocs can resurect on CRAN

# Momocs 1.4.0
* Fixed several minor bugs, mostly with plotting.
* coo_slide duplicated the initial point in some cases. Now fixed.
* coo_likely_clockwise (and friends) now uses complex numbers and is much more robust.
* removed some annoying messages.
* slice(..., 1) now returns a matrix for $coe, not a numeric ([,,drop=FALSE])
* I'm currently out of academia and I'm looking for funding to develop MomX. I plan to give some of my time in 2022 and after but if you have any ideas, either directly or through hiring me for consulting, ring my bell!

# Momocs 1.3.3
* `plot_PCA` and `plot_LDA` did not consistently work within eg `pdf()`. Thanks to Bill fof pointing this. (214)
* coo_shearx/y did not return the Coo. Fixed.

# Momocs 1.3.2
* Turned remaining `return` for `return()` to please R CMD check
* `as_df` now uses `tibble` verbs everywhere
* printing Coo is faster now at the price of sampling 100 shapes on which to calculate the mean number of coordinates and their sd.
* Removed the (quite) annoying startup message. I will not have time for MomX until 2021 anyway

# Momocs 1.3.1
* Changed all `dplyr::as_data_frame` for `tibble::as_tibble`

# Momocs 1.3.0
* **This version will be the last major one released on CRAN. Momocs is now retired and will no longer be maintained. See momx.github.io. As of April 15, 2020 it satisifies all available testing approaches**.
* new multivariate method: `KMEDOIDS` on top of `cluster::pam`. Added a `plot_silhouette` to go with this friend. Now depends `cluster`.
* new multivariate method: `NMDS` on top of `vegan::metaMDS`; use `plot_NMDS` to plot it and `vegan::stressplot` for a Shepard plot. Now depends `vegan`.
* new multivariate method: `MDS` on top of `cmdscale`; use `plot_MDS` to plot it.
* `mshapes` is now `MSHAPES` to stick with other capitalized "multivariate" methods. `mshapes` now just announces its future deprecation.
* `MSHAPES` now just returns data_frame of PCs or LDs when used on `PCA` or `LDA` objects.
* Consequently, `plot_MSHAPES` is the new method for plotting it. Works on lists and on the result of `MSHAPES`.
* `plot_CV` has been refreshed, and is better now at plotting either small or very big matrices.
* `fac_dispatcher` supports `NULL` which eases a lot multivariate plots (notably Momecs side)
* new handling method `rm_missing` to deal with missing data in `$fac`
* `boxplot` methods on Coe have been refreshed
* `hist` methods on Coe deprecated
* `coo_plot` no longer a method and gains a `cex.first.point` argument
* new method: `coo_scalars` that gather all scalar descriptors of shape
* `TraCoe` class properly `data_frame`ize fac when build from `TraCoe()`
* `CLUST` methods have been rewrote and now wraps around `dendextend`.
* Consequently released `ape` dependency.
* all morphometrics methods now accepts `list`s which is more elegant when working with `chop`+`combine`
* `LDA` methods have been partly rewritten and now handles constant and collinear variables by dropping them and storing them in the returned list
* morphospace on LDAs are (finally) back, yet still quite experimental.
* `coo_untiltx` now removes (residual) rotational biases after `coo_slidedirection` and should be used after it.
* `plot_LDA` now on. Pretty much the same as `plot_PCA` (which was expected yet nice).
* `.layerize_LDA` as an internal to prepare the previous
* new vignettes: `Momocs_coo` and `Momocs_FAQ`; others refreshed.
* `morphospace_position` and `chullfilled` in `plot_PCA` now properly working
* `verify` replaces `validate` to avoid conflict with `shiny::validate` (for Momecs)
* `subsetize` now exported (again)
* `def_ldk` gains a `close` and `points` argument
* no more printing of Coo errors that was due to some forgotten `data.frame` rather than `data_frame`
* all `Coo` builders gain a `.data.frame` method, notably to ease compatibility with Momit
* `as_df` now returns more useful `data_frame` everywhere and gain a `retain` argument
* deprecated `coo_angle_edge1` and friends, now in `coo_angle_edges` see 1.2.9.
* fixed minor bugs (see GitHub history of commits)

# Momocs 1.2.9
### Preamble
* Started a general review of Momocs (including #184) to prepare for MomX. For my convenience, all changes will stack on 1.2.5 on GitHub but will appear, in the end, as 1.9.0 on CRAN to both reflect proximity with 2.0 and the huge quantity of changes since 1.2
* Moved everything to `github.com/MomX/Momocs`
* ongoing complete review of code
* ongoing complete review of manual pages: lots of grouping, more and better
* graphics is not dead (aka grindr): pipe-friendly base layers for biplots and shape drawing on cartesian coordinates. Is used to replace all multivariate plotters (eg `plot.PCA`), family pictures (eg `stack` will be replace by `pile` and remove an annoying conflict with `utils::stack`, `panel`) and single shape plotters (eg `ldk_plot`, `coo_plot`). This strategy is faster, much more generic and will ease further development and maintenance compared to previous Momocs graphs.
* A vignette details `grindr` rationale and use.

### New
* new functions: `andnow` and `andnow_method` class tells you what to do with this object, and which classes are supported by this function/method.
* new `coo_*` methods: `coo_range`, `coo_range_enlarge`, `coo_diffrange`, `coo_template_relatively`. The latter will prepare ground for proper size handling, notably for morphospaces.
* Many `coo` functions ported to methods and now supporting `.Coo` directly: `coo_angle_edges`, `coo_angle_tangent`, `coo_boundingbox`, `coo_calliper`, `coo_chull`, `coo_chull_onion`, `coo_circularity`, `coo_circularityharalick`, `coo_circularity_norm`, `coo_convexity`, `coo_dxy`, `coo_eccentricityboundingbox`, `coo_eccentricityeigen`, `coo_elongation`, `coo_intersect_angle`, `coo_intersect_direction`, `coo_intersect_segment`, `coo_perim`, `coo_perimcum`, `coo_perimpts`, `coo_rectangularity`, `coo_rectilinearity`, `coo_scalex`, `coo_scaley`, `coo_solidity`, `coo_truss`.
* Palettes are now those colorblind-friendly from RColorBrewer and those, state of the art, virids palettes. See also `pal_manual`, `pal_qual_solarized` and `pal_seq_grey`.
* `dispatch_fac` is now behind all `fac` arguments
* `fgProcrustes` now accepts lists
# * `efourier` with default `norm=TRUE` now messages about how wrong it may be
* `dplyr::tibble()` everywhere pertinent

### Deprecated
* All `is.*` aliases for `is_*` methods
* Deprecated `classify` for a while
* All `calibrate_*(..., method)` have been renamed to `calibrate_*_method`. See `?calibrate_reconstructions` and friends.
* Deprecated `plot3.PCA` (will be replaced in further versions)
* `Ntable` now splitted into of `plot_table` + `table`
* `coo_tangle` now in `coo_angle_tangent`
* `coo_theta3` now in `coo_angle_edges`
* `truss` now in `coo_truss` and a method of its own
* `plot.Coo` is now `inspect`
* `pos.shapes` is now `morphospace_positions`
* `is_closed` is deprecated, now `coo_is_closed`; same for `is_open` now `coo_is_open`, to comply with all `coo_*` friends naming scheme
* `is_clockwise` is deprecated, now `coo_likely_clockwise`; same for `is_anticlockwise` now `coo_likely_anticlockwise`. Better reflect the incertainty and gather with `coo_*` friends
* Deprecated `table` (poor shortcut anyway and avoid this boring startup message)
* Deprecated `stack2` and `panel2` before their rewriting
* Deprecated `as_Out`, that should have been `efourier_i.OutCoe` anyway.
* Consequently deprecated `panel.OutCoe` method that was additionnaly the only `Coe` method. May be back in further versions.
* Some non-exported functions (ie internals) now homegeneously begin with a `.`, eg `.is.error` (try `Momocs:::. + <Tab>` for a complete list).
* Some previously exported functions are now internals (`function_foo` renamed to `.function_foo`): `.coo_angle_edge1`, `.vecs_param`, `.refactor`
* `NEWS` is now a decent NEWS file
* Online doc has been moved to [http://momx.github.io/Momocs/]

### Dependencies
* Released `reshape2`, `plyr` dependencies
* Now depends `RColorBrewer`, `progress`
* Proper indications of external functions with `::`. A nice side effect is to remove annoying messages when attaching Momocs. Another is the removal of most `importFrom`.

### Breaking changes
* Besides deprecated/renamed functions there should be no breaking changes.
* Future breaking changes are announced within concerned functions.

### Minor
* Waiting for a cleaner fix, `subset` is now `subsetize`...
* Fixed a bug in `LDA` when `retain=1` (#e7704eb)
* Messages homogeneity
* Internals have been lightened
* verbosity and progress bar are now handled via `options("verbose")`
* Various minor bugs fixes, see GitHub
