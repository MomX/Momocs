## Test environments

* local OS X 10.15.6 install, R 4.1.3 with --as-cran on my machine (I know it's old but I have a dependency elsewhere and no workaround)
* but using Github actions and (new) rhub on all latest OS/R versions (there https://github.com/MomX/Momocs/actions/runs/20921509684/job/60108010108) 

## Before release
* Followed devtools::release() and satisfied all requests.

## Reverse dependencies
No breaking change since was archived

## Also
Thanks for your patience, dear CRAN maintainers !
