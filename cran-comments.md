## Test environments

* local OS X 10.15.6 install, R 4.0.0 with --as-cran on my machine
* but using Github actions and R-hub on all latest OS/R versions (there https://github.com/MomX/Momocs/actions)

## Before release
* Followed devtools::release() and satisfied all requests.
* Still has a MikTex related note and a warning on win-devel because of local functions, yet not exposed to user.

## Reverse dependencies
No breaking change for 1 dependent package.

## Also
Thanks a lot, dear CRAN maintainers !
