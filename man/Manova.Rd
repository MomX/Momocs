\usage{
MANOVA(x, fac, test = "Hotelling", retain, drop, verbose)

\method{MANOVA}{OpnCoe}(x, fac, test = "Hotelling", retain, drop,
  verbose = TRUE)

\method{MANOVA}{OutCoe}(x, fac, test = "Hotelling", retain, drop,
  verbose = TRUE)

\method{MANOVA}{PCA}(x, fac, test = "Hotelling", retain = 0.99, drop,
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \link{Coe} object}

\item{fac}{a name of a colum in the \code{$fac} slot, or its id}

\item{test}{a test for \link{manova} (\code{'Hotelling'} by default)}

\item{retain}{how many harmonics (or polynomials) to retain, for PCA
the highest number of PC axis to retain, or the proportion of the variance to capture.}

\item{drop}{how many harmonics (or polynomials) to drop}

\item{verbose}{logical whether to print messages}
}
\value{
a list of matrices of (x,y) coordinates.
}
\description{
Performs multivariate analysis of variance on \link{PCA} objects and on \link{Coe} objects.
}
\details{
For outlines, checks if the matrix of coefficients is of full rank, and if not removes the
higher order harmonics (for Out objects). If OutCoe objects have been normalized, the first harmonic will be removed with a message. If \link{rm_Asym} or \link{rm_Sym}
have been used on OutCoe object, the zero-ed harmonics will be removed with a message.

Overall it is probably a better idea to work on the PCA scores
(and it should ultimately be the same results).

\note{
Needs a review and should be considered as experimental.
