\description{
\code{efourier_norm} normalizes Fourier coefficients for rotation,
tranlation, size and orientation of the first ellipse.
}
\details{
See \link{efourier} for the mathematical background of the normalization.

Sometimes shapes do not 'align' well each others, and this is usually detectable
on a morphospace on a regular PCA. You mat find 180 degrees rotated shapes or bizarre clustering.
Most of the time this is due to a poor normalization on the matrix of coefficients, and the
variability you observe may mostly be due to the variability in the alignment of the
'first' ellipsis which is defined by the first harmonic, used for the normalization. In that
case, you should align shapes \emph{before} \link{efourier} and with \code{norm = FALSE}. You
have several options: \link{coo_align}, \link{coo_aligncalliper}, \link{fgProcrustes} either directly on
the coordinates or on some landmarks along the outline or elsewhere on your original shape, depending of
what shall provide a good alignment. Have a look to Momocs' vignette for some illustration of these pitfalls
and how to manage them.
