\title{Exports Coe objects and shapes}
\usage{
export(x, file, sep, dec)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{Coe} or \code{PCA} object}

\item{file}{the filenames \code{data.txt} by default}

\item{sep}{the field separator string to feed \link{write.table}). (default to tab)
tab by default}

\item{dec}{the string  to feed \link{write.table}) (default \code{"."})
by default.}
}
\value{
an external file
}
\description{
Writes a \code{.txt} or \code{.xls} or whatever readable from a single shape,
a  \link{Coe}, or a \link{PCA} object, along with individual names and \code{$fac}.
}
\note{
This is a simple wrapper around \link{write.table}.

Default parameters will write a \code{.txt} file,
readable by foreign programs.
With default parameters, numbers will use dots as decimal points, which is
considered as a character chain in Excel in many countries (locale versions).
This can be solved by using \code{dec=','} as in the examples below.

If you are looking for your file, and did not specified \code{file},
\code{getwd()} will help.

I have to mention that everytime you use this function,
and cowardly run from R to Excel and
do 'statistics' there, an innocent and adorable kitten
is probably murdered somewhere. Use R!

\examples{
# Will write (and remove) files on your working directory!
\dontrun{
bf <- efourier(bot, 6)
# Export Coe (here Fourier coefficients)
export(bf) # data.txt which can be opened by every software including MS Excel

# If you come from a country that uses comma as decimal separator (not recommended, but...)
export(bf, dec=',')
export(bf, file='data.xls', dec=',')

# Export PCA scores
bf \%>\% PCA \%>\% export()

# for shapes (matrices)
# export(bot[1], file='bot1.txt')

 # remove these files from your machine
 file.remove("coefficients.txt", "data.xls", "scores.txt")
}
