\description{
Momocs is intended to ease and to popularize morphometrics,
the quantitative analysis of form. It aims at gathering the most common approaches:
traditional morphometrics, global descriptors, open outlines, closed outlines
and configuration of landmarks into the same, open-source, environment.
It hinges on the core functions developed in the book \emph{Morphometrics with R}
by Julien Claude (2008), extend them graphically and statistically,
using the same, unified and extendable, grammar. From import from other
morphometrics format or data acquisition, to display, handling,
calibration and calculations on morphometrics datasets on which to apply
an array of statistical analyses, Momocs intends to provides a complete,
convenient and extendable toolkit to specialists within every field that are,
or may be, interested in integrating shape in their researches.
