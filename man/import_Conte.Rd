\title{Extracts outlines coordinates from an image silhouette}
\usage{
import_Conte(img, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{a matrix of a binary image mask.}

\item{x}{numeric the (x; y) coordinates of a starting point within the shape.}
}
\value{
a matrix the (x; y) coordinates of the outline points.
}
\description{
Provided with an image 'mask' (i.e. black pixels on a white background),
and a point form where to start the algorithm, returns the (x; y) coordinates of its outline.
}
\details{
Used internally by \link{import_jpg1} but may be useful for other purposes.
}
\note{
If you have an image with more than a single shape, then
you may want to try `imager::highlight` function. Momocs may use this at some point.
