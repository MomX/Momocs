\method{efourier}{Out}(x, nb.h, smooth.it = 0, norm = TRUE, start = FALSE,

\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{list} or a \code{matrix} of coordinates or a \code{Out} object}

\item{...}{useless here}

\item{nb.h}{\code{integer}. The number of harmonics to use. If missing, 12 is used on shapes;
99 percent of harmonic power on Out objects, both with messages.}

\item{smooth.it}{\code{integer}. The number of smoothing iterations to
perform.}

\item{norm}{whether to normalize the coefficients using \link{efourier_norm}}

\item{start}{\code{logical}. For \code{efourier} whether to consider the first point as homologous;
for \code{efourier_norm} whether to conserve the position of the first
point of the outline.}

\item{ef}{\code{list} with \code{a_n}, \code{b_n}, \code{c_n} and
\code{d_n} Fourier coefficients, typically returned by \link{efourier}}
}
\value{
For \code{efourier}, a list with components: \code{an}, \code{bn}, \code{cn}, \code{dn} harmonic coefficients, plus \code{ao} and \code{co}.
The latter should have been named \code{a0} and \code{c0} in Claude (2008) but I (intentionnaly) propagated the error.

For \code{efourier_norm}, a list with components: \code{A}, \code{B}, \code{C}, \code{D}
for harmonic coefficients, plus \code{size}, the magnitude of the semi-major axis of the first
fitting ellipse, \code{theta} angle, in radians, between the starting and the semi-major axis
of the first fitting ellipse, \code{psi} orientation of the first fitting ellipse, \code{ao} and \code{do}, same as above,
and \code{lnef} that is the concatenation of coefficients.

\description{
\code{efourier} computes Elliptical Fourier Analysis (or Transforms or EFT)
from a matrix (or a list) of (x; y) coordinates. \code{efourier_norm} normalizes Fourier coefficients.
Read Details carefully.

Normalization of coefficients has long been a matter of trouble,
and not only for newcomers. There are two ways of normalizing outlines: the first,
and by far the most used, is to use a "numerical" alignment, directly on the
matrix of coefficients. The coefficients of the first harmonic are consumed
by this process but harmonics of higher rank are normalized in terms of size
and rotation. This is sometimes referred as using the "first ellipse", as the
harmonics define an ellipse in the plane, and the first one is the mother of all
ellipses, on which all others "roll" along. This approach is really convenient
as it is done easily by most software (if not the only option) and by Momocs too.
It is the default option of \code{efourier}.

But here is the pitfall: if your shapes are prone to bad aligments among all
the first ellipses, this will result in poorly (or even not at all) "homologous" coefficients.
The shapes particularly prone to this are either (at least roughly) circular and/or with a strong
bilateral symmetry. You can try to use \code{\link{stack}} on the \code{\link{Coe}} object
returned by \code{efourier}. Also, and perhaps more explicitely, morphospace usually show a mirroring symmetry,
typically visible when calculated in some couple of components (usually the first two).

If you see these  upside-down (or 180 degrees rotated) shapes on the morphospace,
you should seriously consider aligning your shapes \strong{before} the \link{efourier} step,
and performing the latter with \code{norm = FALSE}.

Such a pitfall explains the (quite annoying) message when passing \code{efourier} with just the \code{Out}.

You have several options to align your shapes, using control points (or landmarks),
by far the most time consuming (and less reproducible) but possibly the best one too
when alignment is too tricky to automate.
You can also try Procrustes alignment (see \code{\link{fgProcrustes}}) through their calliper
length (see \code{\link{coo_aligncalliper}}), etc. You should also make the first
point homologous either with \code{\link{coo_slide}} or \code{\link{coo_slidedirection}}
to minimize any subsequent problems.

I will dedicate (some day) a vignette or a paper to this problem.
